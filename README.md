# Live_Classifier 
Live Classifier is the hands-on project for the ML course I am currently taking. In this project, I have used MobileNet to classify real-time images through the use of the webcam. The pre-trained model is very generic and specific object may not be detected 100% accurately. However, it is a great start and introduction to ML.
